# 🚀 React Mini Projects

A collection of 10 beginner-to-intermediate level React mini projects developed as part of a learning lab. Each project is organized into its own folder, with a separate React app and component structure.

This repository is intended to help practice core React concepts such as:
- useState and useEffect hooks
- Forms and input handling
- Dynamic rendering
- Props and component reusability
- React Router
- Styling with CSS

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains a self-contained React app:

- `react-mini-project-2/` – Basic Webpage
- `count/` – React Mini Project 3: Counter (Increment/Decrement/Reset)
- `react-mini-project-4/` – To-Do List
- `react-mini-project-5/` – Dynamic Image Loading Website

- `react-mini-project-8/` – Task Manager
- `react-mini-project-9/` – Nike-Inspired Website using Router, Switch, and Route
