#  React Mini Projects

A collection of 10 beginner-to-intermediate level React mini projects developed as part of a learning lab. Each project is organized into its own folder, with a separate React app and component structure.

This repository is intended to practice core React concepts such as:
- useState and useEffect hooks
- Forms and input handling
- Dynamic rendering
- Props and component reusability
- React Router
- Styling with CSS

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains a self-contained React app:
react-mini-project-1/
react-mini-project-2/
react-mini-project-4/
react-mini-project-5/
react-mini-project-6/
react-mini-project-7/
react-mini-project-8/
react-mini-project-9/
react-mini-project-10/
count/(react-mini-project-3)

> Note: Each folder was initialized using `create-react-app` or similar setup, and then edited individually.
